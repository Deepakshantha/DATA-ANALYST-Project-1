# DATA ANALYST (Project 1)

## Pizza Sales Analysis

### Description (Comprehensive Data Analysis Project Using Excel, SQL Server, and Power BI)
* In my recent data analysis project, I utilized Excel to organize and clean the raw data.
* I then imported this data into SQL Server Management Studio to perform complex queries and data manipulation.
* Finally, I used Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing insightful reports on the data trends and patterns. This comprehensive approach allowed me to effectively analyze and present the data, making it easier to derive actionable insights.
* This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing pizza sales data from the Pizzadetails database. The queries cover various aspects of sales, including total revenue, order counts, average orders, quantities, and percentages of different categories and sizes.

### Database
The analysis is performed on the Pizzadetails database, specifically the pizza_sales table.
